# Sparta-ruby-calculator

### Description
### The task was to make a basic and advanced calculator using Ruby. 

### Technology Used
#### Ruby and atom as the text editor

### Problems
#### I found the task fairly straight forward, I just had trouble with starting the task, however once the basic calculator was finished, the advanced seemed fairly straight forward

### Learning points
#### There are a lot of similarities between the core logic between javascript and ruby.
#### Ruby seems fairly straight forward so far, hopefully can keep up with the pace.
